# RO Mobile: Eternal Love Rune Simulator
Project to convert rune names and descriptions on original calculator to SEA server version in English.  
Also includes some UI cleanup and any various other features/changes I feel like adding.

Translate data get from ROM APK file, so it match 100% with game (yes, even each space).  
You can find it as a json file at `script/ROM-all-text.json`  
Some text still be Chinese cause translate is not avaiable (all of them is Third class+ rune, which not avaiable in SEA)
